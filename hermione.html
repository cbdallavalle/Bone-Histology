        <p>Throughout my first year at Hogwarts, I have prevented the boys' deaths on many, many occasions</p>

        <h3>Death from Devil's Snare</h3>
        <p>After escaping Fluffy's fangs, Harry, Ron and I landed in a pile of Devil's Snare. If you do not know what Devil's Snare is, allow me to educate you. The dastardly ivy will strangle anything that touches it, doubling it's efforts in respose to resistance. However, the plant shies away from light or fire. Luckily I knew the spell to ignite small balls of blue fire, thus saving our necks from a certainly excruciating death.</p>

        <h3>Death from Potions</h3>
        <p>After Ron nearly got himself killed playing Wizard's Chess, Harry and I walked into a room, revealing a table of potions and the door to our next room covered by flames, we had to solve a riddle to discover which potion would allow us to walk through the flames without being burned. I solved the riddle easily and gave the potion to Harry. The bastard drank it all, so I picked up the potion that would transport me back to the Great Hall. Grabbing Ron, I drank the potion. Dumbledore had just walked into the hall, so I told him what a dumbass Harry had been. </p>

        <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>

        <p>What else do I do in my spare time?</p>

        <h3>Earn the best grades in school</h3>
        <p>Honestly, I don't know why everyone struggles so much with homework. If they had just read the textbooks before they came to school, they'd have all the answers. Here are three examples where reading the books helped me excel in class</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Answered all of Snape's dumb questions on the first day of class</li>
          <li>Within my first week, gained 25 points for Gryffindor</li>
          <li>Successfully used Alohamora</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Read in the Library</h3>
        <p>The school library is a fountain of knowledge</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Read</li>
          <li>Read</li>
          <li>Read about Nicholas Flammel</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="fun-facts">I am really quite smart</h2>
        <h3>A bit more about why I am fabulous</h3>
        <p>It's hard to choose, since there are so many reasons</p>
        <ul>
          <li>My frizzy brown hair is GORGEOUS</li>
          <li>My wand is made with dragon heartstrings, DRAGON HEARTSRINGS</li>
          <li>I know all the spells</li>
        </ul>
