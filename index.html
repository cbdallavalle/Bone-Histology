  <h1>Reading New Stories in Old Bone</h1>

<div class="intro">

	
  <h2>What Do Bones Tell Us?</h2>
	<p class="introP">You may think that bones are these boring, supporting 
structures of your body. However, bones are dynamic; growing and changing in response to many differnet influences, both inside and outside of the body. Things like gender, age, metabolism, and surrounding environment can influence how the microstructure of bone grows. Suddenly, a bone becomes like a book, where you can read the microstructure to learn about the life of an animal. This is the study of bone histology, or osteohistology.</p>

<div class=medullaryDiv>
	<h2 class="boneCharacteristics" id="medullary">Medullary Cavity</h2>
  <p class="characteristicsP">The Medullary Cavity is found running vertically on the inside of a bone. This is where bone marrow is stored. The Medullary Cavity can range from being nearly hollow, where little bone is found inside the cavity, to being almost filled with bone. Often, this can correlate with the type of lifestyle an animal was living</p>

</div>

	<h2 class="boneCharacteristics" id="primary">Primary Bone</h2>
		<p class="characteristicsP">Primary bone is made up of proteins and minerals that are first deposited as a bone develops. These proteins and minerals are deposited in an organization gradient. In an animal that grows rapidly, the proteins are laid down quickly and haphazardly, creating a microstructure that looks disorganized. This is called Woven Bone. In an animal that grows slowly, the proteins and minerals are placed in an orderly pattern. This is called Lamellar Bone. An animal that grows somewhere in between these growth rates, will have a mix of both. This is called Parallel-Fibered Bone. </p>
  <img class="characteristics4" src="/Users/casey/Turing/Prework/prework/myWebpage/images/primary.jpg" alt="Examples of Woven, Parallel-Fibered, and Lamellar Bone" />

	<h2 class="boneCharacteristics" id="vasculature">Vasculature</h2>
  <p class="characteristicsP">Vasculature is defined as the amount of blood vessels captured in a bone. Bone is an organ, and like any other organ in the body, needs access to the oxygen and nutrients that blood vessels carry. Blood vessels surround bones, and as they grow, bones capture the blood vessels in their rigid microstructure. The vasculature in a cross-section of bone looks like little circular holes (longitudinale vasculature) or oval holes (radial vasculature) puncturing the surface. A high density of vasculature indicates an animal had a high growth rate, where a low density of vasculature signifies a low growth rate. Radial vasculature correlates with a high growth rate, as well. </p>

<h2 class="boneCharacteristics" id="secondary">Secondary Bone</h2>
  <p class="characteristicsP">In addition to the structural support bones provide the body, they also act as nutrient storage. When the body needs extra nutrients, the bone can be broken down or eaten away so that the stored nutrients are released into the blood stream, and available to be used elsewhere in the body. When those extra nutrients are not further required, the body will send incoming nutrients and minerals back to the bone for storage. When nutrients are redeposition, they cause signatures in the bone that look like life-savers.</p>

  <h2>Time to Analyze!</h2>
  <h5>Example 1</h5>
  <img class="examplePics" id="turtleImg" src = "/Users/casey/Turing/Prework/prework/myWebpage/images/turtlehisto.jpg" alt="Example of Bone Histology" />
  <ul class="results"> 
    <li>The primary bone is organized in neat, concentric circles. This is an example of slow growing Lamellar Bone. In addition, the primary bone holds little vasculature. Both characteristics point to a slow growth rate.</li>
    <li>The medullary cavity is filled with bone and extends significantly into the primary bone itself. This microstructure is typical of animals that spend large periods of time underwater.</li>
    <li>There is little secondary remodeling, indicating the animal had a low remineralization rate, and therefore, low metabolism.</li>
  </ul>
  <p id="examplep">This bone belongs to a fossilized turtle from Madagascar. The conclusions we made from the bone correlate with what we already know about turtles in general. They are cold-blooded, so they grow at a slow and constant rate and they have a low metabolism. They also spend much time underwater.</p>
 
  <h5 id="example2">Example 2 - can you see the signals for yourself?</h5>
  <img class="examplePics" id="crocImg" src="/Users/casey/Turing/Prework/prework/myWebpage/images/crochisto.jpg" alt="Example of Bone Histology" class="examplepics" />
  <ul class="results">
    <li>The primary bone has a more haphazard growth pattern than the turtle but still maintains some organization. This is an example of Parallel-Fibered bone. Many small blood vessels run through the bone, however, they are noticeably ordered in concentric circles.</li>
    <li>The medullary cavity is hollow, a characteristic distinctly different from the turtle bone. A hollow cavity is typical of animals that live in aquatic lifestyles.</li>
    <li>The secondary bone is present but not significant</li>
  </ul>
  <p id="examplep">This is bone belongs to a fossilized, fine-boned aquatic crocodile from Madagascar. We can make the conclusion that this crocodile had a medium growth rate, but definitely faster than the turtle. The hollow medullary cavity is hypothesized to allow for greater buoyancy in water.</p>
